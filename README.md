# About the Project
Isolation was a critical issue for remote workers during the Pandemic. The Water Cooler aimed to tackle this issue by allowing users to fill out a survey about themselves and have their coworker's responses be returned to them. From this point, users could then contact like-minded coworkers and make a connection. 

# Tech Stack
The project orginally had a node.js and express.js API, PostgreSQL database and was hosted on AWS EC2. The frontend was built with JavaScript and BootStrap. The project is no longer live.
