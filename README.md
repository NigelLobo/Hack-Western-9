# About the Project
Isolation was a critical issue for remote workers during the Pandemic. The Water Cooler aimed to tackle this issue by allowing users to fill out a survey about themselves and have their coworker's responses be returned to them. From this point, users could then contact like-minded coworkers and make a connection. This problem was tackled within a team of 4 programmers. 

# Tech Stack
The project orginally had a Node.js and Express.js API, PostgreSQL database and was hosted on AWS EC2. The frontend was built with JavaScript and BootStrap. The project is no longer live but can be viewed at http://thewatercooler.tech:4321/
